system ordering

player/ai do their turn
-They send event to advance to next turn
-They send event for handling their movement or attack or whatever

movement/attack needs to be picked up by its system to be handled

collidables need to be assigned to collidable resource (requires stage change to be detected)

turn advance event needs to be picked up so it can get the next entity doing their thing

repeat

new system ordering

event is fired for turn start. systems that handle turns pick this up and use it. event contains entity. systems compare this entity to whatever query they have to see if they're meant to handle it.
