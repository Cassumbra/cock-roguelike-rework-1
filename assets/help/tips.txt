Tips


Avoid engaging multiple enemies at once. You excel at taking down targets one at a time. It is costly to focus on more than one enemy at a time.

Avoid engaging in prolonged ranged combat. Guns are powerful and will rip you to shreds. The average melee attack is 2.5 while the average ranged attack is 4.5.

Avoid combat in general. It is better to sneak up on your enemies and catch them unaware. It can be quite effective to wait for a single target to wander towards you if you see what direction they are headed and you can hide out of sight.
